For centuries, coffee production has been a rudimentary task involving a huge consumption of energy along with a significant environmental impact. For instance, after selecting and milling, green coffee beans are then heated up in a gas-fired roaster for a given time, resulting in different flavors and characteristics for the consumer. 
However, such roasting emissions are known to be a big issue for the environment, where toxins in the smoke such as allergens, volatile organic compounds and greenhouse gases are released into the atmosphere. Since coffee consumption per day is quite significant - according to a study by the International Coffee Organization, just in the United States there are consumed 400 millions cups of coffee per day - it has become rather important to develop new technologies to improve efficiency and sustainability in the large production chain of making a cup of coffee.
